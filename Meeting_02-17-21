Website is live, now time to start working on it, need to post our names and roles as
well as the daily meeting logs. a list of txt files works just fine. We also need to
decide on what technologies we will be using for the app development. Proposed so far
is Vscode for the ide to test the code, however what frontend, middleware, and backend
we are using is still undecided. Though a combination of Bootstrap, Ruby on Rails, and
either SQlite or MySQL was brought up. Lets do some research before next meeting so we
can decide what we are using. As for hosting either AWS or Heroku.
